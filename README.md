Hi, my name is Erica Jacquemain ðŸ‘‹

I'm a SR Graphic Designer and JR Web Developer from Argentina, based in Buenos Aires. I love everything that has to do with Graphic design, Motion graphics, UI/UX design, and I recently found a new passion: Web development.

My 20 years professional experience working on studios, marketing and BTL agencies, and print-house makes me a highly meticulous sense of aesthetic, along with an special close attention to every detail. 

Iâ€™m currently learning After Effects, and in 2022 I'll be learning UI/UX design.

I love working with people, specially if they have the same passion I have for what they do.
